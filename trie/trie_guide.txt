1. Describe structure of single unit in a trie. What makes it diff from other structures?
- A node in a trie has two parts: one that tells whether a complete sequence ends there, and another that holds the possible next parts of the sequence. Unlike other structures, it doesn’t store just a single value — it stores a decision point and a map of next steps. This makes tries great for working with prefixes and fast lookups.

2. Describe three trie operations, check/add/build-path
Check: Starts at the top and follows each part of the sequence step by step. If it reaches the end and a marker shows it's complete, the sequence is found. If any part is missing, it’s not there. 
Add: Goes through each part of the sequence, using existing paths if they exist or creating new ones if they don’t. At the end, it marks the sequence as complete. 
Build new path: For a brand-new sequence, it creates a fresh path from the top, step by step, linking each part. At the end, it marks the full sequence as valid.

3. Time complexity for those three operations?
- All operations have a time complexity of O(n). This means that the time complexity depends on the number of parts in the sequence (like the number of letters in a word). It does not depend on the total number of sequences stored in the trie.
